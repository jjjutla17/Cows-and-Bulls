# Cows-and-Bulls
Cows and Bulls is a guessing game where the player tries to guess a number that has been randomly generated. The randomly generated number must contain exactly four digits between 0 and 9 with no duplicates. An example of a valid randomly-generated number is 1234. An example of an invalid randomly-generated number is 1223 as the digit 2 has been used twice in the four-digit number. The player is asked to enter a four-digit number. This is compared to the randomly-generated four-digit number. Each individual digit entered by the player is compared to each digit within the randomly-generated number. If a digit is in the randomly-generated number and is in the same position in the randomly-generated number as it was in the player’s number then the digit is a “bull”. If the digit is in the randomly-generated number but is in a different position then the digit is a “cow”. The player has won the game when they have correctly guessed the four digit randomly-generated number. A record is kept of the number of guesses it took to guess the correct number.
